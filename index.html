            <p id="about-text">I'm a Midwest transplant who recently decided to switch careers. I currently am working
                in
                the food & beverage industry and took a step down from my role as a director of operations to dedicate
                myself
                to going back to school. I am a people person and tend to be very easy going. I get along well with my
                peers
                and thrive when problem solving collaboratively as well as on solo projects. I have managed four
                separate
                businesses grossing over $4M in annual revenue. I have gained the respect of my employees and treat
                everyone
                fairly and with respect. I am very much looking forward to collaborating with likeminded individuals on
                new
                problems in my future career. Now, intro into me discovering UW's Coding Bootcamp for full-stack web
                development. I have taken the first steps toward
                jumpstarting my progress into a new career. I have dabbled with code in the past and decided to take the
                plunge and get the ball rolling for myself and my family.</p>
            <p id="about-text2">I am newly and happily married, and very excited to be starting this next chapter in my
                life. My wife and I have a goal to move to Hawaii while we are still young. I am animal lover and care
                for
                two fur babies currently, but soon to be more in the future.</p>
